# Topic Modelling using the sentiment analysis models like LDA and RNN

The following project was made as a college minor project and took me around a month to completely execute it according the outputs I needed.


Topic Modelling and sentiment analysis are the basis of getting intriguing and observable results about how effective and how relevant a particular document is about a topic. We used the LDA model and RNN model and compared their relevance of results about how effectively each of them works on Datasets of Education Reviews, Airlines Reviews, and General Tweets by people. following to that, we tried to optimize the results by these two Models and predict the best model.

Learnings: 

This repository will guide you how to completely execute and work on the datasets provided.

All the folders clearly describe their contents and i've also provided the output which will be generated as the program progresses.

Objectives Learned:

1. Effective application of LDA and RNN models on different Datasets.
2. Optimization and minimization of load on the models during execution.
3. Results show how LDA and RNN are differently accurate for the use of sentiment analysis in a particular field of work.
